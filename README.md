# reCAPTCHA Test Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to integrate Google reCAPTCHA into a login form using a Node.js backend with Express.js. reCAPTCHA helps protect your web application from spam and abuse by using a CAPTCHA (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart). The reCAPTCHA challenge requires users to solve a test that is difficult for bots but easy for humans, such as identifying objects in images or solving simple puzzles.

## Features

- Integration with Google reCAPTCHA for form submissions.
- Verification of reCAPTCHA responses on the server-side using Express.js.
- Simple login form with username and password fields.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A Google reCAPTCHA site key and secret key. You can obtain these by registering your site at [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha).
